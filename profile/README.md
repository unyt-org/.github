### üåç Our paradigms
1. **Everyone is equal** - unyt should help to promote an open, democratic and inclusive digital society where all participants share the exact same rights and no central authorities shall be in control.

2. **Privacy is a human right** - unyt is designed to protect human rights and to empower individuals to control their own data and communication. The platform should form a secure environment for free speech and information exchange, without fear of surveillance.

3. **We are unyt** - No single authority shall be responsible for the future of the project, since this would make them to a potential non-autonomous central authority. This statement implies that its term "we" can represent anyone participating.
