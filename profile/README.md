## Hey, this is unyt üëã
The vision of unyt is to provide a decentralized, secure, and private platform for data transfer and communication that eliminates single points of failure and ensures trust and availability. We focus on privacy, security, scalability to allow everybody to communicate safely. The ultimate goal of **unyt** is to establish a fully decentralized world wide web that is accessible to everybody üåç. Yes, everybody!

### üöÄ Our paradigms
1. **Everyone is equal** - unyt should help to promote an open, democratic and inclusive digital society where all participants share the exact same rights and no central authorities shall be in control.

2. **Privacy is a human right** - unyt is designed to protect human rights and to empower individuals to control their own data and communication. The platform should form a secure environment for free speech and information exchange, without fear of surveillance.

3. **We are unyt** - No single authority shall be responsible for the future of the project, since this would make them to a potential non-autonomous central authority. This statement implies that its term "we" can represent anyone participating.


### üõ∏ We are unyt
**unyt** operates on the belief that a decentralized network is only as strong as its community. The network is designed to be fully open-source and transparent, allowing all participants to contribute to its development and evolution. This approach ensures that the network is always evolving and improving, and that the community is always at the forefront of its growth and success.
The term *"unyt"* does not define any specific group or individual, but rather, it represents the collective efforts of the entire community. **unyt** is intended to be a project that is inclusive and open to all and operates on the principle that everyone has the ability to contribute and have a meaningful impact on the project and its future.

The motto **"We are unyt - everyone can be!"** encapsulates this spirit of equality and inclusivity and reinforces the belief that a decentralized network is only as strong as its members.
