We are building a decentralized, secure, and private platform for data transfer and communication that eliminates single points of failure and ensures trust and availability. We focus on privacy, security, scalability to allow everybody to communicate safely. 

The ultimate goal of **unyt** is to establish a fully decentralized world wide web that is accessible to everybody. Yes, everybody!

### üåç Our paradigms
1. **Everyone is equal** - unyt should promote an open, democratic and inclusive digital society where all participants share the exact same rights and no central authorities are in control.

2. **Privacy is a human right** - unyt is designed to protect human rights and to empower individuals to control their own data and communication. The platform should form a secure environment for free speech and information exchange, without fear of surveillance.

3. **We are unyt** - No single authority shall be responsible for the future of the project, since this would make them to a potential non-autonomous central authority. This statement implies that its term "we" can represent anyone participating.
