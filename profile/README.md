# üëã Hi, welcome to the unyt.org GitHub

We are building a decentralized, secure, and private platform for data transfer and communication that eliminates single points of failure and ensures trust and availability: **The Supranet**!

We focus on **privacy**, **security** and **scalability** to allow endpoints to communicate safely.

## üåç Our paradigms
1. **Everyone is equal** - unyt.org promotes an open, democratic and inclusive digital society where all participants share the exact same rights and no central authorities are in control.

2. **Privacy is a human right** - unyt.org is designed to protect human rights and to empower individuals to control their own data and communication. The platform should form a secure environment for free speech and information exchange, without fear of surveillance.

3. **We are unyt** - No single authority shall be responsible for the future of the project, since this would make them to a potential non-autonomous central authority. This statement implies that its term "we" can represent anyone participating.
